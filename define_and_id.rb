# Run each line of code below (either from this file or in IRB individually).
#  Then, in a ruby comment, write 1-2 sentences describing what is happening, using ALL the involved vocabulary terms you've learned in this lesson so far.

# EXAMPLE
# The upcase method is called on the string object "Hello World"
# No arguments are passed; upcase has one clear job which is to capitalize all letters that exist in the String
# The return value is "HI"
"Hello World".upcase
#what this code it doing it is grabbing the variable and capitalize the whole variable

"Hello World".include?("Hello")
# this is checking if the string is there and if it is it will print true

"Hello World".end_with?("Hello")
#This is check going to check it the string ends with Hello

"Hello World".end_with?("rld")
#this is checking it it will end with rld and yes it does so it is true

"Hello World".length
#this is cheking how many elements there is in the string

"Hello World".size
#it is the same thing as .lenght
